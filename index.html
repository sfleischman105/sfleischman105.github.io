<p>Welcome to my blog! I plan to write here about interesting things that I encounter, stuff I've coded, and whatever I feel like writing about.</p>

<p>Since I'm currently learning <a href="http://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, expect some content regarding this cool language. I also work in Java, so that may show up here and there, too.</p>
